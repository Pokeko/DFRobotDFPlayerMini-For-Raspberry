UPDATE
======

I fork the project of Angelo qiao to use it with Python and Raspberry. It's totally the same except the code is translate to Python.

The utility is to use the UART on the raspberry and launch sounds at specific times of the day using cron under Raspberry.

I modified the code to be able to communicate on the serial port with Python and not with the Arduino libraries.

Thanks to Angelo qiao for his work
